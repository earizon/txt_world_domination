## Beacon API:  Sending analytics [[{]]
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Beacon_API
The Beacon API is used to send an asynchronous and non-blocking
request to a web server. The request does not expect a response.
Unlike requests made using XMLHttpRequest or the Fetch API, the
browser guarantees to initiate beacon requests before the page is
unloaded and to run them to completion.

The main use case for the Beacon API is to send analytics such as
client-side events or session data to the server.
