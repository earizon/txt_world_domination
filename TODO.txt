# Feature Requests

## Custom 'highlight' tags
* Example:
  ```
  - Risk     : eg: Rº**
  - Keypoint : eg: Kº**
  - Important: eg: Iº**
  * ... 
  ```
tags must be independent of rendering (as color, decorated, ...)
 
## Use Beacon API [[{]]
* "anonymous analytics"
* [REF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Beacon_API)
  The Beacon API is used to send an asynchronous and non-blocking
  request to a web server. The request does not expect a response.
  Unlike requests made using XMLHttpRequest or the Fetch API, the
  browser guarantees to initiate beacon requests before the page is
  unloaded and to run them to completion.
    
  The main use case for the Beacon API is to send analytics such as
  client-side events or session data to the server.
