# Bugs [[{QA.BUG]]

## pre blocks do not indent properly. 
* Right now, pre blocks/paragraphs are parsed "asymetrically" respect to other 
  type of content since rendering is completing different (pre is actually 2-dimensional
  while anything else is 1-(DOM-tree)-dimensional actually).<br/>
  Check Python mardown parser as reference. It uses the concept of "sibling" to
  "join" related pre (paragraphs) into a single block ("unit of information").<br/>

  See also pre-processing and post-processing for reference.

* Fix: 
  ```
  [[{ $topicA ]]
  ...
     [[{$topicB} ]]
  ...
  [[  $topicA}]]
  ```
  when selecting topicB, topicA must be displayed as "related" topic.

* In "AND" mode selecting a "topic.*" does not work.

# Work in Progress [[{PM.WiP]]

## Allow for common or prefix tags.  [[{QA.UX]]

* For example, allow a given tag to be added to all internal paragraphs.
  ```
  [[{$ common.tag+]]
  paragraph 1 [[{$ tag1}]]  <·· common.tag automatically added
  paragraph 2 [[{$ tag2}]]  <·· common.tag automatically added
  [[$ common.tag-}]]
  ```

## Support for Mermaid Diagrams.  [[{QA.UX]]
* This will allow for sequence/BPML/Gantt/... diagrams "for free".

## Encryption support [[{security.secret_mng,use_case.privacy]]
* Allow to publish encrypted content in public pages.
* Ideally encrypted content is not displayed to "recipients"
  without the proper "cryptographic artifacts". For example,
  if using a public encryption key, only those with the private
  key will show the content.
* Consider also support for 
  [Bell LaPadula security model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%E2%80%93LaPadula_model)
[[security.secret_mng}]]

## Custom 'highlight' tags?  [[{QA.UX]]
* sort of  'lightweight" markdown extensions for common "highlighting" patterns. 
  * Example:
    ```
    | - Risk         : eg: Rº** some risk **
    | - WARN         : eg: Wº** some warning **
    | - Keypoint     : eg: Kº** some keypoint **
    | - Tip/Reminder : eg: Tº** some reminder **
    ```
  * Ummm, the fewer non-standard extensions the best.
  * Comment: Maybe this just maps to translating to a set of common and 
    well-known, well-defined tasks.
  * In any case tags must be independent of rendering even if viewers
    are allowed to assign default styles (color, text decoration, ...).

## Add "transparent" mindmap support [[{QA.UX]]
* Re-enable old "Single Page Book Project" "map-with-zoom view". Example:
  <https://earizon.github.io/IT_notes/General/cryptography_map.html?showSearchMenu=true>
  NOTE: It was visually (much) more attractive but note-taking was not effective 
  with lot of manual html tagging.
  The idea is to take notes "a la markdown" (plain text with plain text editors) and
  autogenerate anything else (views) automatically.
* See also: <https://markmap.js.org/docs/markmap>. Markdown+mindmap combination. <br/>
  NOTE: It looks to "just" render the index with arrows, visually appealing but not very
   useful. There is no way to "walk in a graph".
