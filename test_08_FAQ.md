# FAQ

**Q**: Why file extensions in github are `*txt` and not just `*md`.
**A**: Sometimes Github is too much strict with the markdown parsing 
when publishing new pages. By renaming to `.txt` this checking is
bypassed. Our markdown reading will continue to parse txt files as
markdown for convinience.<br/>
Other extensions like familiar programming language ones (`.java`, `.py`, ...)
and converted first to pre-formated code. The tagging system contines
to work properly.
