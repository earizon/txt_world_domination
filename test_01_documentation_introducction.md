# DOCUMENTATION INTRODUCTION

Documenting is not about piling words and powerpoints
in random locations hoping that some poor soul will read
them in future.

Documenting is not about looking cool or serious or expert

* Perfect documentation is a science-fiction dream
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoAk7zBTrvo> ...
* ... but good documentation is possible.
* Text books are examples of good documentation (or at least they ought to)...
* BUT ... text-books require lot of expertise and free-time to create.
* In real projects we still need good documentation and the more
  people working in a project the biggest the need to have good
  documentation but ....
* REAL WORLD is a very imperfect REAL WORLD.  [[{DOC_HAS.KEY-POINT]]
  * Projects misserably fail.
  * Companies spend lot of money in project managers, scrum masters, QA specialists, ITIL masters, ...
    none of which understand each other.
  * Real workers doing real work end up NOT doing real work in order to satisfy each other's EGOs and
    interests.

## Why wasting time writing booOOoooring documentarion?

* BAD DOCUMENTATION MAKES US LEAVE THE OFFICE LATER.
* Outside pure academic's enviroments, documentation skills are not
  even considered when hiring new employees acording to 99% of job's
  offers (while in pure academic's enviroment publishing
  papers looks to be the only important thing to do with no
  attention to any other real outcome).
* PROPER DOCUMENTATION (TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE)  IS A CORE TASK OF ANY SUCCESFUL PROJECT.
* TAKE CONTROL OF THE INFORMATION BEFORE THE INFORMATION TAKES CONTROL OF YOU!

##  ABOUT THE TXT WORLD DOMINATION PROJECT

[[{DOC_HAS.KEY-POINT]]
* TXTWD Project tries to implement documentation best
practices by converting a simple and innocent "txt" file
into a INDECENT and PERVERT Document Management System
where information can be searched and classified in
powerful ways to success in creating correct documentation
(aka TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE)
