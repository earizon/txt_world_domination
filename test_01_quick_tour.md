# Welcome to the TXT World Domination Project

 The TXT WD extensions allows to label standard markdown content with multidimensional
`topic.subtopic` labels and create, classify and keep ordered an "ever growing" number
of notes and documents. 

 There are powerful search engines allowing to find lost information, documents and 
email, but it is much better to never loose such information in the first place.



## Quick Tour

* The topics menu ( **click  ∷ button** ) allows to select content based on multidimensional
  "topics", filtering out non selected contect with a granularity of 
  one or more paragraphs.
* The index menu ( **click '≣' button** ) shows a conventional index with "chapters" and
  "sections". If topics have been selected, only chapters and "sections"
  included will be listed.
* Finally, **clicking on '◂' button** let you hide all control pannels.
* You can use your favourite text editor to write the markdown content.<br/>
  To see how the output looks in real time while editing source markdown,
  open the browser in parallel with a txt editor used to edit the markdown,
  go to settings(⚙), and change the default refresh rate from the default
  (1 hour/3600 secs) to just a few seconds (7 secs will be enough unless
  you write "too fast").

## TEST 1: Get sure readers understand the importance of good documentation

by making a copy of the following paragraph:

> """ ... The documentation and samples are still bad today ...  We ended up
> with a painful difficult-to-understand, hard-to-test,
> even-harder-to-modify mess. Not because we didn't follow the "(Google
> Android) best practices", but precisely because we did!...a large
> part of the official  documentation and samples are still poorly
> written. And it continues to mislead the new generation of
> inexperienced developers. And as Uncle Bob would tell you, most
> developers are new since the IT industry double its size every five
> years ..."

## TEST 2: Make sure readers understand the key points when creating documentation:

* ✓ PUTTING RELATED INFORMATION CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.
* ✓ DON'T REPEAT TWICE.
* ✓ USE YOUR HARD DISK TO SAVE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, NOT PILES OF
    DOCUMENTS SPREAD ("HIDDEN" OR "LOST") AMONGST HUNDRED OF EMAILS,
    POSTS, CHATS, WORDS, CUSTOM DATABASES, EXCELS AND BINARY FILES OF
    RANDOM NATURE.
* ✓ DON'T USE PROPRIETARY FORMATS FOR IMPORTANT DOCUMENTATION:
    THE SIMPLEST, THE BEST.
* ✓ AVOID USING (EXPENSIVE AND COMPLEX TO SETUP AND MAINTAIN)
    SEARCH ENGINES TO FIND FOR LOST INFORMATION:
    NEVER LOOSE THE INFORMATION IN FIRST PLACE.

## TEST 3: Make sure readers understand that text files "is all you need"

* Let's make sure by adding links to well known World Wide successful 
  projects documented with plain text that are now part of Human HISTORY:
  1. TCP/IP Internet Protocol Documentation:
    <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt>
  2. HTTP "Web" protocol:
    <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616>
  3. Linux Kernel documentation:
