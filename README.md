# txt_world_domination
Serverless CMS (**just plain text!!!**) with a supporting
[ligtweight HTML viewer](https://github.com/earizon/txt_world_domination/blob/main/viewer.html) and
a [micro db-engine](https://github.com/earizon/txt_world_domination/blob/main/txt_ddbb_engine.js)
supporting multidimensional taxonomy classification.

Refer to the [test page](https://earizon.github.io/txt_world_domination/viewer.html?payload=test.txt) and
the original [txt file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earizon/txt_world_domination/main/test.txt) to 
get an idea of daily ussage.

Since content is just plain text (vs some weird binary database format) it means that many tools can be reused to 
[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors) 
and
[manage](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/textutils-2.0/html_mono/textutils.html) the content
following the "Do it once and do it right!" UNIX philosophy.

**Current state**: "works for me!" , **no markdown support yet**.
